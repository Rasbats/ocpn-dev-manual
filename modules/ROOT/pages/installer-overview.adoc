= Plugin Installer Overview

The plugin installer is, from 5.2.0 the normal way to install plugins. The 
installer is designed around some concepts

Tarball::
A tarball is (in this context) the complete plugin which the installer
installs. It is basically the result of `make install` packed together
with metadata. The layout is fixed and documented in 
xref:plugin-installer:ROOT:Tarball.adoc[here]

Metadata::
The plugin metadata contains plugin name, version and an url from which
the tarball can be downloaded. These are a central parts, but there is
more defined as documented  xref:plugin-installer:ROOT:Catalog.adoc[here]

Catalog::
The catalog is the list of plugins available for an OpenCPN installation.
The UI in the program, a list of plugins, is based on the catalog.

Librarian::
The librarian, really Dave, manages the catalog which is continously 
updated.
