Extensive documentation

== Build and Deploy Plugins

Alec Leamas is the author of PI Installer and should be given extensive
credit & thanks for his many months of work on the Plugin Installer. Jon
Gough has also generously spent many months to improve the PI Dev
experience by his extensive work revising and improving the Build and
Deploy side of PI Installer, the CMake and CI files needed at the head
of any plugin that supports PI Installer.

To understand more detail about the entire system, please also review
https://github.com/leamas/OpenCPN/wiki[Plugin Installer Documents]

NOTE:

* It is important to get Key #1 and Key #2 entered correctly, provided
you need them.
* KEY #1 is only needed to PUSH the build back to your Github RELEASE
Repository.
* Github OpenSource accounts are Public and easily accessible for
download by the BUILD services.
* KEY #2 is needed to give the BUILD services the ability to PUSH to
CLOUDSMITH.

== PI Manager System consists of three parts:

=== 1. Plugin Manager inside OpenCPN

The plugin manager is now in OpenCPN master branch. Make a fresh build
of opencpn from this branch. There are occasional improvements made now.

=== 2. Plugin Build & Deploy by Plugin Devs

FIXME We need to simplify

. Step by step
. List of files needed
. Provide two sample file packages for download
. To be applied to the plugin (provided they are working)>

CMake and CI Files from Jon Gough's much improved
https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi[testplugin_pi] using the
"cmake_flatpak_test" branch. These are pre-configured with the code
required to create the compressed binary and metadata xml files needed
for the PI Installer to work. These files create plugin binary and
metadata xml catalog files for various operating systems, utilizing git,
the plugin's GitHub repository, Appveyor, Travis and Circleci to build,
and the Cloudsmith repository for deployments. The earlier
https://github.com/mauroc/squiddio_pi[squiddio_pi] CMake and CI Files
were a significant step in the development process, however we recommend
use of the files in Testplugin_pi. Also please note that the CI parts,
while useful, are not necessary to use the installer. As long as there
is a working file with metadata and a downloadable tarball everything is
fine, at least for a starter.

=== 3. Metadata Repository:Git OpenCPN/Plugins

FIXME

. Diagram: to explain relationship between CLOUDSMITH REPO and
OPENCPN/PLUGINS
. Purpose: To collect all the plugins metadata.xml's for the tarballs
and push them to opencpn/plugins master:beta:alpha branches.

https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins/blob/master/DEVELOPER-INFO.md[OpenCPN
plugins project README] The github repository that stores plugin
metadata files (submitted by Pull Request), and the python code to
create a single "ocpn-plugin.xml" file of plugin metadata for use by the
PI Installer. This file contains all the necessary PI information and
locations of files. Dave R. has control of this github repository and
will accept PRs

== Assumed Cloud Services

We assume you have or are able to configure the following free
opensource accounts/services:

. Code Repository https://github.com/[GitHub]
. Deployment Repository https://cloudsmith.io/[Cloudsmith]
. Build Tool https://circleci.com/[CircleCI] Needs authorizations from
Code & Deploy repositories. Preferred.
. Build Tool https://www.appveyor.com/[Appveyor] Needs authorizations
from Code & Deploy repositories.
. Build Tool https://travis-ci.org/[Travis-CI.org] Needs authorizations
from Code & Deploy repositories.
. Build Tool https://travis-ci.com/[Travis-CI.com] Needs authorizations
from Code & Deploy repositories.

These next steps add build and deployment of multiple OS to Git Release
and Cloudsmith for PI Installer.

== Plugins Adaptation

You may have to adapt the plugin in various ways. Please review the
items in this link
https://github.com/leamas/OpenCPN/wiki/Plugin-adaptation[Plugin
Adaptation]

== GITHUB Personal Token Generation and Use

KEY #1 provides your BUILD (Appveyor,Travis-ci or Circleci) service the
ability to PUSH artifacts (tarballs, xml, packages) back to your GitHub
RELEASE repository.

Provide access for APPVEYOR, TRAVIS-CI and CIRCLECI to your plugin's
GitHub repository, so that these accounts can clone the repository in
order to build the plugin. FIXME (This needs to be confirmed, it is an
opensource public account, so no auth_key may be needed.)

. From your GITHUB account [Username]

....
    - Select Settings
    - Pick Developer Settings
    - Pick Personal Access Settings
    - Enter 'git-ptoken-[plugin]-into-appveyor' or 'git-ptoken-[plugin]-into-circleci' or similar, etc
    - Then copy and save the 'number' for use below to provide CIRCLECI, APPEVEYOR and TRAVIS with credentials to access and download from your personal GitHib repository (for each plugin and each service).
    - You will need a separate Github Personal Access Token for each plugin, and each service (Appveyor, Travis)
- From your CIRCLECI account
    - See [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#circleci_build_account|CIRCLECI (Build Account)]]
- From your APPVEYOR account
    - Plugin, then select Setting (gear on top line to the right)
    - Pick Environment (left menu)
    - Pick Environment variables (in the center entry area).
    - Pick Add Variable.
    - Enter name "GIT-PTOKEN-[pluginname]-INTO-APPVEYOR"
    - Enter value, which you saved, from GitHub.
    - Pick SAVE at the bottom.
    - Now simply use "GIT-PTOKEN-[pluginname]-into-APPVEYOR" with your appveyor.yml file
    - Note: Appveyor used to give you an encryption number to at the bottom of the appveyor.yml file [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#appveyoryml|Appveyor.yml file example]].
- For TRAVIS-CI  [[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/|Travis-CI Encryption Docs]]
    - First install [[:opencpn:developer_manual:ci-push-build-to-git#c_install_travis_cli_to_encrypt_a_github_secure_public_key|Travis CLI]] to encrypt a github secure public key.
    - Then [[https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:developer_manual:ci-push-build-to-git#d_encrypt_a_github_api_token_with_travis_encrytion|Encrypt a Github API Token with Travis CLI Encryption]] using the Personnal Access Token 'number' you saved from Git.
    - Then use the resulting 'encryption' in the [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#travisyml|.Travis.yml file example]].
    - For more information about Travis encryption of a Github Personnal Access Token see [[:opencpn:developer_manual:ci_travis_encryption_windows|CI:Travis Encryption for Windows]]
    - For more information about Travis encryption using Linux and TravisCI see [[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/|Travis Encrypting]].
- After setup, Refer to [[:opencpn:developer_manual:ci-push-build-to-git|How to push build to Git using Appveyor and Travis]]

== CIRCLECI (Build Account)

. Open a (free) open-source account on circleci.com
https://circleci.com/signup/[Signup] with your GitHub account
. You will be allowing CircleCI certain types of access to your GitHub
account.
. Start following your GitHub plugin project on Circleci.
. In CircleCI

....
    - Under settings create a "context" with [username]
    - Prerequisites: Config.yml uses workflows and you must be an admin.
    - Under settings "Enable Github Checks" [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/enable-checks/#section=projects|https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/enable-checks/#section=projects]]
    - Under Settings > VCS > "Manage Github Checks"? Yes
    - [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#section=projects|Environment Settings and API tokens]]
    - Context- Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. The environment variables are defined as name/value pairs and are injected at runtime. [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/|https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/]]
- In **//Project > Build Settings > Build Settings > Environmental Variables//**  to set up security.
- See [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#cloudsmith_api_key_generation_and_use|CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY Generation and Use]]
- Add environment variables to the job. You can add sensitive data (e.g. API keys) here, Private environment variables enable you to store secrets safely even when your project is public, see Building Open Source Projects for associated settings information. Use Contexts to further restrict access to environment variables from within the build, refer to the "Restricting a Context" documentation.
- [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/oss/|Building Open Source Projects]]
- Put your //**Cloudsmith Deployment Key**//  in your //**Circleci account> Settings> [user]> squiddio_pi> Env Variables**//  as "CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY" .
- The squiddio_pi/ci/circleci-upload.sh file uses the name "CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY"
- Typical Setttings: Since building a PR is one way to make sure it works, if someone wants to help you out, therefor please enable the //Build forked pull requests//  option which should make circleci build all PRs. If //Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests//, is Disabled, it will not be able to upload anything.

== CLOUDSMITH Deployment Repository

Create your own CLOUDSMITH Deployment Repository. The shipped
configuration uses cloudsmith.io. This is not a requirement in any way,
but this is how to get the shipped setup working. Setup a Cloudsmith.IO
Free Opensource Account:

. Go to Cloudsmith.io https://cloudsmith.io/user/signup/ to sign up for
a free opensource account using your github account.
. After the 7 day trial, you may be asked for credit card, as long as
you stay public opensource with the base services, it should not cost
you. Don't get alarmed when it looks like they want money. Open-source
repos are free.
. Create [user name] For Example: "firstname-lastname"
. Create 3 repositories named

....
    - [pluginname_pi]-prod
    - [pluginname_pi]-beta
    - [pluginname_pi]-alpha
- OR (if you plan on deploying multiple plugins)
    - opencpn-plugins-prod
    - opencpn-plugins-beta
    - opencpn-plugins-alpha
- Which will store compressed binary files and metadata xml catalog built by circleci.
- Create a [new repository] by clicking the "+" and then use one of the names above. Make sure you fill in the 'Slug' with exactly the same text as you used in 'Name' or you repository may not work as you expect and debugging is difficult.
- Make sure you select "Opensource" (not Public) and complete the rest of the information appropriately, see below.
....

image:/opencpn/dev/cloudsmith-create-repository.png[Cloudsmith create
Repository,width=600]

. When completed the new repository should have a "heart" icon which
when hovered over shows "Opensource".
. For each new repository select:

....
    - Under "Set me up" dropdown on the right side, select "Raw"
    - See notes below for setting up [[:opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installler_build_deploy#cloudsmith_api_key_generation_and_use|CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY Generation and Use]].
    - Test each repository to make sure you can upload and download a file using the web UI.
    - Then at the bottom "Upload Packages" button.
....

== CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY Generation and Use

KEY #2 provides your BUILD service the ability to PUSH artifacts
(tarballs, xml, packages) to your CLOUDSMITH repository.

Provide your unique CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY to other services such as
CIRCLECI, TRAVIS and APPVEYOR to give them permission to DEPLOY to
CLOUDSMITH.

. Copy the API key from your CLOUDSMITH Account on
https://cloudsmith.io[https:__cloudsmith.io]] by - Get the key from
cloudsmith account page. Click the user name icon, upper right, and you
will be able to copy the key to clipboard. - Left click your logon-id in
the top right of the cloudsmith main page - Then click 'API Key' - You
will be asked for 'Elevated Privileges' and need to supply your
password. - Then your key will be displayed. - Copy this (either select
the whole key and copy or click the paper clip icon at the right hand
end of the key line) - Now use your Cloudsmith key in the appropriate
accounts below to provide access to Cloudsmith for deployment. - Sign
into your CIRCLECI account on
[[https:__circleci.com|https:__circleci.com]] * Select 'Settings' in the
left hand vertical toolbar * Then 'Projects' * Then the settings icon
(gear wheel) of the project (plugin_pi) you want to use. * Click
'Environment Variables' under 'BUILD SETTINGS', * Click "Add Variable" *
Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Value Field.. * Add
'CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY' into the Name Field. * Close by clicking Add
Variable. - Sign into your APPVEYOR account on appveyor.com
[[https:__appveyor.com|https:__appveyor.com]] * First add the plugin
project. The plugin name should show in the upper left. * From the
plugin page go to Settings in the top menu. * Select Environment from
the side menu. * Under Environment Variables select Add a Variable. *
Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Variable Field and enter
CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY into the Name Field. * Click Add Variable. - Sign
into your TRAVIS account on
[[https:__travis-ci.org|https://travis-ci.org]

....
      * Select the plugin project so that it shows at the top.(eg: weather_routing_pi)
      * Select from the upper right "More Options". Then "Settings" from the dropdown.
      * Scroll down to Environment Variables.
      * Paste the Cloudsmith key into the Value Field and enter CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY into the Name Field.
      * I select All Branches.
      * Select Add. See the screenshot.
....

Once this is done the deploy to Cloudsmith should work.

== Cloudsmith Retention Policy Settings

Example: A repository with 4gb and about 5000 packages used for
development. Retention policy set some time ago but these have not
disappeared. Deleting them 25 at a time is impractical. Response: This
is normally a misunderstanding of how the retention functionality works.
Retention Policy only kicks in when a repository is uploaded, even for
time-based retention. Also, you've currently got "Group Packages By
Name" enabled, which means it is is counting per package name, rather
than the packages in total. The 33 packages count you have means you'd
have to have 34 versions of a named package before it deletes them. If
you'd like to keep 30-days worth of absolute packages, just untick the
box and we'll trim it down to 30 days after the next upload.

Some more information on how retention works here:
https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/retention-lifecycle

Also, for manual actions, at the bottom of the packages list page,
there's an "X Per Page" selector, where you can change the setting from
25 packages to 500. So if you really needed a manual action to
delete/copy/move many packages at once, you can do it like that.

== Setup: Configure Plugin for PI Installer

== Summary of Process

. Configure your plugin's files by replacing cmake and circleci scripts
and modify them appropriately.
. Create free opensource accounts with circleci and cloudsmith, and set
up opensource repositories.
. Test building and deployment to the cloudsmith "beta" repository.
. Use Opencpn with the PI Installer to open the new [ocpn-plugin.xml
metadata catalog to confirm installation and test the plugin.
. After testing, issue a new version, pushing new binaries to cloudsmith
repositories, along with a new ocpn-plugin.xml catalog file.
. See link:/opencpn/developer_manual/pi_installer_procedure.adoc[PI Installer
Procedure Build-Deploy] below, for more detail.

== Add CMake and Script Files

FIXME

Your plugin will need to be augmented with new CMake and script files.
There are two versions you can select from Frontend1 and Frontend2.

. The main Frontend1 example is in
https://github.com/bdbcat/oesenc_pi[github.com\bdbcat\oesenc_pi] and a
more annotated version is in
https://github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi/tree/frontend1[rgleason/squiddio_pi
branch frontend1]
. The main Frontend2 example is in
https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi[github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi]
and more annotated
ashttps://github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi/tree/frontend2[github.com/rgleason/squiddio_pi
Branch frontend2]

The simplest way is to copy the new files in ci & cmake to your system
and make the requisite changes to the CMakeLists.txt, of which there
shouldn't be too many as it is really the individual plugins file, i.e.
has all the customization in.

All changes for customisation should be constrained to the
CMakeLists.txt file, because all the other files are parameter driven
and so 'should' be the same between plugins. So all the files in the:

. 'cmake' directory, including the in-files directory, are the same for
every plugin, there should be no customisation to these files. There are
'extra' cmake files which a plugin may use, i.e. FindPortaudio.cmake for
the weather_routing_pi, but these are supplied by the plugin and are
referenced vis CMakeLists.txt in the plugin customisation section.
. 'ci' directory should not require hand customisation as again all the
files are parameter (global variable) driven
. '.circleci' directory should not require hand customisation as again
all the files are parameter (global variable) driven
. 'debian' directory should not require hand customisation
. 'mingw' directory should not require hand customisation

Updates of plugins require copying the above directories in place and
then carefully updating the CMakeLists.txt file by referencing the
testplugin_pi version to change it to the new format and include all the
'standard' parts that are needed. It should be quite easy to get it
working, while testing on the web takes longer as jobs need to finish,
to determine what needs fixing.

So if you look through the first section of the CMakeLists.txt you will
see where you set the cloudsmith user and repository name as well as the
'special' stuff for the xml file. The next section down you may need to
change a few default settings, i.e. 'USE_GL', or some special version of
c++ that is needed. In the current file the following section (line 194
onwards) is where you define all the files to be used. You will need to
keep 'SRCS' as the source list, but the rest of it is up to you. You
will also need the last section which does the rest of the build and
package process.

I would not try to 'combine' this process with any other in the same
'stream' or you are likely to have problems. When I make changes just
copy the new files in place and, if needed, make the co-requisite
changes to CMakeLists.txt .

The idea of this process is that it is a 'black box' to most and it
should 'just work'. You will notice that I have changed the names of the
repositories to '…-prod', '…-beta' and '…-alpha', it just seemed to
match what was going into them. The destination repository is controlled
by what you are doing, i.e. -

....
  Any non-master branch network build -> alpha repository
  Master build without tag and non-master branch build with tag -> beta repository
  Master build with tag -> prod repository

....

All 'installation' files, 'deb', 'dmg', 'exe', etc will also go into the
same repository, but they will have the current naming strategy, i.e.
will start with 'opencpn-plugin-' the the rest of the descriptive name.

Download and Use the CMake and CI files listed below from Jon Gough's
https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi[Testplugin_pi] using the
"cmake_flatpak_test" branch. Download and install the files into a new
branch on your plugin local repository.

== Modify Files

Then the top of CMakeLists.txt must be customized for the plugin and
environment. There are basically two sets of files for CMake that have
been developed. One set comes from Alex Leamas and the other set comes
from Jon Gough's testplugin_pi which is being used as a template. Jon
has gone to some effort to bring all the Plugin Dev settings up to the
top of CMakeLists.txt The example below is from Jon's testplugin_pi but
needs to be updated!

== Other Notes

== Cloudsmith OpenCPN Organization

https://cloudsmith.io/orgs/opencpn/

There are 3 repositories that can be used.

Developers of Plugins can be invited to join the organization after they
have created an opensource Cloudsmiith account.

See this https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1573

== Installation Destination change with Plugin Manager

https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/issues/1605

Check your plugins for any changes needed to keep intended user
experience when installing, noting path isssues.

== Catalog XML "name" must match "Common Name"

The name used in the Plugin Manager XML Catalog must match the "Common
Name" of the plugin being installed.

In order for the Plugin Manager to work consistently, the "name" tag in
the catalog's XML must match the "Common Name" of the plugin being
installed. The (sometimes inconsistent) values in CmakeLists.txt do not
affect the plugin manager at run-time. Example catalog xml record:

....

The name "WeatherRouting" must match the "Common Name" which comes from
the source code, weather_routing_pi.cpp, in github:

....
wxString weather_routing_pi::GetCommonName()
{
    return _("WeatherRouting");
}
