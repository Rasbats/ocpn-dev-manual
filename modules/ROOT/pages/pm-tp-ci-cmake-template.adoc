= Testplugin CI-CMake Template

----
Plugin: Testplugin_pi
Github: https://github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi
Author: Jon Gough
CI-CMake Template  v1.0.160
----

== Features

----
Fully functional plugin
Uses OCPN interfaces and demonstrates how to use the ocpn_draw_pi API set, both the JSON and Binary versions.
Continuous Integration and CMake package.
Guidance for the automated build process.
Cmake, CMakeLists.txt and scripts needed to compile the environments.
Encapsulates the complexities of multi environment builds and deploys to make it easier to build and deliver plugins.
All plugin changes can be made in CMakeLists.txt, i.e. adding source and header files, there is no need to modify the other build files.
Delivered to OpenCPN Plugin Management User Interface using metadata files via the https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins(OpenCPN  Container Project for an Integrated Plugin Management Facility - github.com/opencpn/plugins)
----

**GOAL**: Assist plugin developers to convert their plugins to the Plugin Manager system which:

* Uses tarballs and metadata.xml files to store the necessary files and provide information.
* Deploys directly to Cloudsmith repositories (or another location)
* Online Files are accessed by OpenCPN Plugin Manager using "Library Catalog" (metadata.xml)
* Plugins are installed from within OpenCPN **Options > Plugins** by User selection of a Plugin in an updated Catalog.

The template configuration is found in github.com/jongough/testplugin_pi.

== Rename Existing Directories and Files

=== Create a new Git branch:

. Keep your currently working "master" branch intact. Create a new git branch.
. EG: 'git checkout -b ci-cmake master'
. Work in the new branch 'ci-cmake'.

=== Copy original files for backup:

* Rename CMakeLists.txt ----> CMakeLists.txt.bk
* Rename appveyor.yml ----> appveyor.save.yml.bk
* Rename .travis.yml ----> .travis.save.yml.bk
* Rename the cmake directory ---> cmake-bk
* Keep any other specialized plugin directories or files.

=== Directories to Remain

* Include
* Data
* src
* po

Take care. Add any other specific plugin directories essential to your plugin.

== Copy Folders & Files from Testplugin_pi

=== Add Directories, Sub-dir and Files

Copy from testplugin_pi to the same location in the new plugin:

* testplugin_pi/.circleci
* testplugin_pi/ci
* testplugin_pi/cmake
* testplugin_pi/buildosx
* testplugin_pi/mingw
* testplugin_pi/extinclude  (JSON Validation - only Ocpn_draw, watchdog, weather_routing)
* testplugin_pi/extsrc  (JSON Validation - only Ocpn_draw, watchdog, weather_routing)
* testplugin_pi/ocpninclude
* testplugin_pi/ocpnsrc
* testplugin_pi/appveyor.yml  (file)
* testplugin_pi/.travis.yml   (file)

=== Files

Review and Compare.

* testplugin_pi/appveyor.yml  (compare with your file)
* testplugin_pi/.travis.yml   (compare with your file)
* testplugin_pi/CMakeLists.txt  (see in line notes, major editing comparing to old file)
* See notes below for more detail

=== Directories NOT needed

The following directories and files are not needed from testplugin_pi

* testplugin_pi/data
* testplugin_pi/forms
* testplugin_pi/include
* testplugin_pi/lib
* testplugin_pi/ocpninclude
* testplugin_pi/ocpnsrc
* testplugin_pi/src

== Changes Required

1. Rename CMakeLists.txt, appveyor.yml, .travis.yml adding  .save for reference.
1. Modify CMakeLists.txt file, following the in-line notes
  - Modify Personal Specifics about Line 20 to 75.
   - Enter setup information:
     - Plugin name types
     - CommonName -search "plugin"_pi.cpp for "GetCommon"
     - Version numbers and date
     - Parent, Package and Git User. Git Repository
     - Cloudsmith User
     - Cloudsmith Base Repository (optional)
     - Plugin XML Info_url, Summary and Description
   - In the section that replaces testplugin specific code:
     - Modify/configure the set(SRCS and HDRS and 'Include' Directories using CMakeLists.save.txt
     - Modify/configure 'Set(SRCS & HDRS' Directories using CMakeLists.save.txt
     - Modify/configure 'Add Library' listings for the plugin.
     - Make sure all your necessary libraries are found.
     - Add/Modify a statement like this to join all of your project's set(
       - EG: add_library(${PACKAGE_NAME} SHARED ${SRCS} ${HDRS} ${NMEA0183} ${LIBSSRC})
1. API Number must be at least 1.16 for the new Plugin Manager, due to a change in how directories are found and location.
1. API Names have been changed from MY_API_VERSION_MAJOR and MY_API_VERSION_MINOR, to OCPN_API_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR
   - OCPN_API_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR are now used in cmake/in-files/version.h.in
   - In the file (pluginname_pi).cpp the are several lines which need to be changed from MY_API_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR to
     - EG: "return OCPN_API_VERSION_MAJOR;"
     - EG: "return OCPN_API_VERSION_MINOR;"
   - Also in file (pluginname_pi).cpp find   wxString (pluginname_pi)::GetCommonName() and change
	 - return _("(pluginname-pi)");  to
     - return _T(PLUGIN_COMMON_NAME);
   - In the file (plugin_pi).h there are several lines which need to be commented out.
     - // #define     MY_API_VERSION_MAJOR    1
     - // #define     MY_API_VERSION_MINOR    16
	 - or removed.
     - Because the new values definitions are defined in cmake/in-files/version.h.in
1. Cmake Files are somewhat generic, but often can be plugin specific, depending on the plugin.
   - Review the cmake.save files one by one with the new ones and make necessary adjustments.
   - Configuring this is not simple and requires knowledge about the plugin operation.
1. Get the ci/environment scripts working on Circleci, Appveyor and .travis-ci
1. Then get the uploads to Cloudsmith working.
   - First create your Cloudsmith Account, then join the OpenCPN Organization as a member of the Plugins Team.
   - Once you are accepted as a member, you will be able to create three repositories for your plugin.
   - The management of Cloudsmith has advised that Organizations will in the future be restricted to having repositories in the Organization's Folder, so it is best to start out that way.
   - Configuration of uploads to Cloudsmith destinations:
     - ci\cloudsmith-upload.sh points to  ..cmake\in-files\cloudsmith-upload.sh.in
     - See for standard repository directories.
       - @CLOUDSMITH_BASE_REPOSITORY@-prod
       - @CLOUDSMITH_BASE_REPOSITORY@-beta
       - @CLOUDSMITH_BASE_REPOSITORY@-alpha
     - The Frontend2 defaults to 'CLOUDSMITH_BASE_REPOSTORY' = 'yoour Github Repository', however you should set this value in CMakeLists.txt as "opencpn"
     - In the organization "OpenCPN" create (pluginname)-alpha, (pluginname)-beta and (pluginname)-alpha repositories.
	 - Make sure that you select "Open Source", not just "public". It must be "Open Source"
     - See the more detailed instructions in the Developer's Manual wiki.
   - For custom Cloudsmith repository destinations, modify if needed.

== Deployment

The current setup for Frontend2 plugins does this:

* Non-Master branch - Push with no tag -> Alpha repository
* Non-Master branch - Push with tag -> Beta repository
* Master branch - Push with no tag -> Beta repository
* Master branch - Push with tag -> Prod repository

 There are several ways to issue a "push with tag" or "tagged push"
    - See https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:developer_manual:pi_installer_procedure#deploy_to_prod_repository
  $ git commit -am "my last changes")
  $ git tag v[new version number]
  $ git push <repo-name> <tag-name>  OR
  $ git push origin refs/tags/tag_a

Not preferred:
  $ git push --tags origin master:master  <--- Is not preferred due possibility of pushing all old tags..

Example:
1. Change version number and date in  CMakeLists.txt . Save
1. git add CMakeLists.txt
1. git commit -am "v1.9.5.10"
1. git tag v1.9.5.10
1. git push origin refs/tags/v1.9.5.10
  -  Enumerating objects: 5, done.
  -  remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
  -  To https://github.com/xxxx/weatherfax_pi.git
  -  * [new tag]           v1.9.5.10 -> v1.9.5.10
1. git push origin master

=== Add Plugin xml files to the Plugin Manager Catalog

Add your new Metadata xml to Plugin Manager Catalog
Make Pull Request to github.com/OpenCPN/Plugiins

After Circleci, Travis and Appveyor have built the environments and deployed to one of the Cloudsmith Repositories, the resultant metadata files (.xml) must be copied and pushed up too the plugins master branch github.com/OpenCPN/plugins to become part of the the master catalog. Jon Gough has provided some bash/python scripts that accomplish copy to your local branch to assist or you can simply do this part manually.

Generally try not to use raw git commands unless really needed, In Linux & Windows install the 'beta' testing version (for free opensource work) SmartGit (sometimes it hasn't had all the capabilities of git).

==== Use a Manual process and script to move metadata.xml to github.com/plugins.
After completing  (Ewdwe ro Read-Build.md)
1. Initial Setup of Remote Fork and Local Repository
1. Set remote upstream and origin
1. Create a new local branch, i.e. master or beta or alpha using upstream/master

Update your local github/plugins  (master, beta, alpha branches)
1. git pull upstream master  <---need our local repos to match opencpn/plugins (master branch)
1. git push origin master  <---just updating our remote repository.

Next copy the metadata.xml files from Cloudsmith to your local github/plugins metadirectory (master branch)
Use the Git-Gui (bash prompt) from your local github/plugins' folder, to run Jon's bash script.
Note if you used an "_" in the name, try using "-" to get it to work!
1. Run: 'download_xml_bash.sh' with the correct parameters for your cloudsmith repository and build.
1. Examples
   1. ./download_xml_bash.sh <cloudsmith_repository> <plugin_version>  <cloudsmith_user>  <cloudsmith_level>
   1. ./download_xml_bash.sh testplugin_pi 1.0.114.0 jon-gough prod
   1. ./download_xml_bash.sh weather-routing 1.13.8.0 opencpn prod

Next remove only your own OLD metadata.xml files from your local github/plugins/metadata directory. Leave the other xml files alone!

Then add the changed files, commit and push to remote origin master branch
1. git add metadata/    To add the metadata files
1. git commit -am "[pluginname] v[version number]"         Commit the metadata files
1. git push -u origin rg-master    (Does the same as two commands 'git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/jg_master'  and 'git push')

Goto upstream/master in a web browser and create pull request to OpenCPN/plugins master  <---- from [gitusername]/plugins rg-master
We can leave the local rg-master branch in place until the next job (see above)

=== Weatherfax_pi specific differences from testplugin_pi "Frontend2"

Weatherfax_pi needs to have sound support for Windows and Mingw, additionally use with rtlsdr requires additional files.

1. circleci/config.yml  -same
1. ci/ all scripts same except
   - ci/control  weatherfax has 'build librtlsdr-dev'
   - ci/circleci-build-mingw.sh downloads and installs portauduio & PVWcon32.exe
     - wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencpnplugins/opencpn_packaging_data/PVW32Con.exe
     - wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencpnplugins/opencpn_packaging_data/portaudio-vc12.7z
     - 7za e portaudio-vc12.7z -o../buildwin -y
     - mv PVW32Con.exe ../buildwin/.
1. cmake/  all the files in testplugin are used in weatherfax and are identical
1. cmake/  weatherfax has 3-4 of its own files too
1. cmake/in-files/ has all the same files
1. extinclude   all the same
1. extsrc   all the same
1. mingw
   - opencpn-deps.spec file has
     - BuildRequires: p7zip
     - BuildRequires: wget
1. .travis.yml  same
1. appveyor.yml  (same except the path & name of plugin and the api key)
1. CMakeLists.txt  -similar, very different in places,
   - personnal settings,
   - "USE_GL ON" for weatherfax,
   - plugin name is different,
   - libraries and includes all different.
