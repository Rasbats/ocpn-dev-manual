== Troubleshooting

For trouble shooting and lower level nitty gritty details, the command
line, configuration files and debuggers are your friends.

=== OpenCPN has a minimal command line interface (CLI)

....
Usage: opencpn [-h] [-p] [-fullscreen] [-no_opengl] [-rebuild_gl_raster_cache] [-parse_all_enc] [-unit_test_1 <num>]
  -h, --help                    Show usage syntax.
  -p                            Run in portable mode.
  -fullscreen                   Switch to full screen mode on start.
  -no_opengl                    Disable OpenGL video acceleration. This setting will be remembered.
  -rebuild_gl_raster_cache      Rebuild OpenGL raster cache on start.
  -parse_all_enc                Convert all S-57 charts to OpenCPN's internal format on start.
  -unit_test_1:<num>            Display a slideshow of <num> charts and then exit. Zero or negative <num> specifies no limit.
....

==== [-unit_test_1]

This command test cycles through all possible charts in the currently
loaded chart database, adjusting the viewport to show the loaded chart
automatically. The value of this test is clear: it provide an unattended
stress test of OpenCPN, It is most fun to watch in quilt modeâ€¦

The test runs until all charts in the database have been visited once.
Lets think of this as a Beta test tool.

A side-effect of this switch is that it can be used to process a set of
ENC charts into SENC files. The first, time consuming processing of ENC
charts, can this way be done unattended.

==== [ -p ]

The portable option is explained
link:/opencpn/opencpn_user_manual/advanced_features/portable_opencpn.adoc[]

==== [-no_opengl]

A total switch-off of OpenGL, in a more thorough way than in "Options".

==== [ -fullscreen ]

Starts OpenCPN in FullScreen mode

=== Debugging Output Settings for Logfile

The _config or ini_ file contains a lot of settings that are saved
between sessions. +
*Debug statements can be added to produce a lot of output when problems
arises in certain areas.* +
The following statement are recognized and can be added to the config
file before a session starts. +

....
[Settings] ...
DebugOpenGL=1   Add logfile debug output for openGL.\\
DebugNMEA=500   Writes 500 NMEA sentences to the log file\\
DebugCM93=1     Writes volumes of debug info relating to CM93 to the logfile.\\
DebugGPSD=1     This will produce some more log output regarding gpsd.\\
DebugS57        Add logfile debug output for S57\\
DebugBSBImg     Add logfile debug output for BSBImg\\
DebugGDAL       Add logfile debug output for GDAL\\
....

=== Using a FIFO for ais debugging.

See the code in _ais.cpp_ +
`+/*
   A special test for a user defined FIFO
   To use this method, do the following:
   a.  Create a fifo            $mkfifo /tmp/aisfifo
   b.  netcat into the fifo     $nc $ip $port> /tmp/aisfifo
                   sample ip port could be  nc 82.182.117.51 6401 > /tmp/aisfifo
   c.  hand edit opencpn.conf and make AIS data source like this:
        [Settings/AISPort]
        Port=Serial:/tmp/aisfifo

  This also works if you have an ascii ais log
  for which you can simply $cat ais.log> /tmp/aisfifo
  */
  if(m_pPortName->Contains(_T("fifo")))
        goto port_ready;
+`

You may see that if the port name contains the string "fifo", then the
requirement for the port to be a TTY is relaxed.

=== wxWidgets

OpenCPN uses wxWidgets, currently version 3.0.2.
https://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/[wxWidgets Reference Manuals] . The Often
the version used is behind the most current one, because the developers
are trying to maintain compatibility with older OS and Computers as much
as is possible. Sometimes wxWidgets has bugs and a different routine is
needed, or the developers figure out a workaround. Sometimes the fix is
in a more current version of wxWidgets than is being used by OpenCPN so
the developers then also try figure out workarounds.

Also a change in wxWidgets generally affects all plugins, so that they
all need compilation and the the new versions are no longer operable in
previous versions of OpenCPN and the older plugins quite obviously won't
work in the the new version of Opencpn. This is another reason the
changes to wxWidgets versions is infrequent.
